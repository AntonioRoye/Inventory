# Inventory
Python inventory tracker GUI

GUI was built using PyQt5 and functions were imported from inventory module to supplement functionality.

The app will track inventory using a GUI and print status to console.

Before using make sure to edit email settings in inventory.py to your account info. They will be used to send an email to a recipient when a certain stock has run out

For ease of use convert the GUI.py file into an .exe using auto-py-to-exe and set the file to "One file" instead of "One directory" to create an ap functional application
